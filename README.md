# BCD to Gray Code Converter

This web application is a BCD to Gray Code Converter created as part of an EC201 Digital Logic Design project. The application allows users to convert Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) values into their corresponding Gray code equivalents. It is designed for easy access through a QR code embedded in a poster. Scanning the QR code will redirect you to this web page, which demonstrates the functionality of the converter.
